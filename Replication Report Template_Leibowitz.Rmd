##Introduction 

Sloman 2016's paper describes 4 studies assessing a “community of knowledge.” A community of knowledge is the perception that because others understand something, I also understand it. This effect is seen when other’s knowledge increases my own sense of understanding of something. Participants in this study were told they were in a study about recent scientific discoveries, and participants read descriptions of newly discovered phenomena and rated their own understanding (1-7 scale). Half of these descriptions indicated that scientists had explained these new phenomena, while the other half of these descriptions indicated that these new phenomena were still poorly understood and therefore unexplained. In all four studies, Sloman & Rabb found evidence for a community of knowledge: when scientific discoveries were described as being fully understood and completely explained by scientists, participants rated that they understood these discoveries better - even when no explanation of the scientific discoveries was provided.

This project will replicate study 1, which presented descriptions of newly discovered scientific phenomenon that were described as either understood and explained or not understood and unexplained. Sloman & Rabb found that ratings of understanding were generally low (Ms = 1.79(unexplained) and 2.42(explained)), but a paired samples t-test revealed that understanding was significantly higher in the explained condition: (M=.28, 95% CI = [0.21, 0.35]) than in the unexplained condition: (M=0.20, 95% CI = [0.15, 0.25]), t(69)=-3.40, p=.001, Cohen’s d=0.43). 


##Methods 

Methods adapted from Rosenthal & Rabb 2016, page 1452.

Participants will be recruited using Amazon's Mechanical Turk in return for a small payment. The instructions will explain in detail how to use a rating scale to reflect a sense of causal understanding. A cover story will indicate that the study concerns recent scientific discoveries. Participants will read four fictional descriptions of newly discovered natural phenomena and rate their understanding on a scale from 1 to 7 (1= little to no understanding, 7=detailed and deep understanding). Each participant will read two descriptions indicating that a given phenomenon has been thoroughly explained by the discovering scientists (communal knowledge condition) and two indicating that it has not yet been explained (no communal knowledge condition). The order of items and conditions will be fully counterbalanced. Participants will also answer a question about mood as an attention check. 

###Power Analysis 

Original effect size: d=.43
Power analysis for samples to achieve same effect size:
80% power: n=45
90% power: n=59
95% power: n=73
Considerations of feasibility for selecting planned sample size: Very feasible to run 45 participants for 80% power.

###Planned Sample 

Planned sample size: 45
Data will be excluded for failing manipulation check.
12/82 (14.6%) of original sample failed manipulation check, so should plan to inflate sample size by at least 15% and therefore will run 55 participants to be safe.

###Materials

Materials are eight descriptions of scientific discoveries: 4 that indicate a community of knowledge and 4 that don't indicate a community of knowledge. 

> 
A May 19, 2014 study in the journal Geology reported the discovery of a new rock that scientists have not yet explained. The rock is similar to calcite, yet it glows in the absence of a light source. The authors of the study, Rittenour, Clark, and Xu, do not yet understand how it works; they provided a description of the remarkable appearance of the mineral and outlined future experiments.
How well do you understand how glowing rocks work?

> The journal Ecology Letters recently reported a rare weather subsystem that scientists have not yet explained (“Liquified 2He clouds form near the Cape of Good Hope,” Marchetti, May 28, 2014). This weather system effectively rains liquid helium. The author of the study does not understand how it works, but she described the visual appearance of the helium rain and discussed additional measures to be taken next year.

> An April 3, 2014 study in the journal Nature reported the discovery of a species of fish that scientists have not yet explained. The unusual fish is similar to Xiphosphorous Nigrensis but effectively can fly. The authors of the study, Danica and Frith, do not understand how it flies; they provided a visual description of the body of the fish and discussed further directions of research.

> The journal Science recently reported a protein-like ice crystal that scientists have not yet explained (“Hexagonal crystalline structure in moderate environments,” Arden, Kayas-Gupta, & Overby, June 4, 2014). The ice crystal forms even in warmer temperatures. The study’s authors do not understand how it works, but they described the visual appearance of the crystals and proposed future avenues of research.

###Procedure	

> "Eighty-two U.S. residents (40% female, 60% male; mean
age = 31.3 years) were recruited using Amazon’s Mechanical
Turk and participated in return for a small payment.
Sample size was chosen to satisfy counterbalancing
schemes and was in keeping with related prior research.
The instructions, adapted from Rozenblit and Keil (2002),
explained in detail how to use a rating scale to reflect a
sense of causal understanding. A cover story suggested
that the study concerned recent scientific discoveries.
Participants read four fictional descriptions of newly discovered
natural phenomena and rated their understanding
(“How well do you understand how ___ works?”) on
a scale from 1 to 7 (1 = little to no understanding, 4 =
moderate understanding, and 7 = detailed and deep
understanding). Each participant read two descriptions
indicating that a given phenomenon had been thoroughly
explained by the discovering scientists (communal
knowledge, or CK, condition) and two indicating that it
had not yet been explained (no-CK condition; see Table 1
for examples). The order of items and conditions was
fully counterbalanced. Details about the scientists and
reporting journals were included to camouflage the
manipulation, but the descriptions contained no causal
or explanatory information. Participants then answered a
question about mood that was incorporated as an attention
check."

The only exception to the original article will be the number of participants recruited for the study. 

###Analysis Plan

Analysis plan:
Participants who fail the manipulation check will be excluded from analyses.
Means for ratings of understanding of both conditions will be calculated. Assuming these responses will be positively skewed (representing relatively low understanding), a log transformation will be used to increase the normality of the scores.
(Key analysis of interest): A paired samples t test of the log transformed scores will then be calculated to assess if understanding is significantly higher in one condition than the other. Confidence intervals and effect size will also be calculated. 

###Differences from Original Study

Explicitly describe known differences in sample, setting, procedure, and analysis plan from original study.  The goal, of course, is to minimize those differences, but differences will inevitably occur.  Also, note whether such differences are anticipated to make a difference based on claims in the original article or subsequent published research on the conditions for obtaining the effect.

We will be recruiting a different, smaller sample size than in the original study based on a power calculation based on the effect size found in the original study. Additionally, the original study does not specify whether the survey was coded on Qualtrics or directly on Amazon mTurk, so it is possible that running the study on Qualtrics would be a difference from the original study. Finally, the authors do not specify exactly how the original counterbalancing was done, so this reproduction will use our judgment to try and best randomize and counterbalance the presentation of stimuli. 

I do not anticipate that these differences will influence our ability to reproduce effects from the original study.

###Pilot A (added in by KL)

I ran 4 pilot participants to ensure the directions worked well and that things randomized properly. After piloting I made some changes to page breaks, and in the end the randomization worked and everything went smoothly. The order that stimuli appeared for each of the four participants were as follows:

weather not explained
fish not explained 
ice explained
rock explained
manip check

weather explained

fish not explained
rock not explained

## Discussion

### Summary of Replication Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the confirmatory analysis and the assessment of whether it replicated, partially replicated, or failed to replicate the original result.  

### Commentary

Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis, (b) assessment of the meaning of the replication (or not) - e.g., for a failure to replicate, are the differences between original and present study ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the replication attempt.  None of these need to be long.
