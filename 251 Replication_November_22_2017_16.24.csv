Start Date,End Date,Response Type,IP Address,Progress,Duration (in seconds),Finished,Recorded Date,Response ID,Recipient Last Name,Recipient First Name,Recipient Email,External Data Reference,Location Latitude,Location Longitude,Distribution Channel,User Language,"The journal Science recently reported a protein-like ice crystal that scientists have thoroughly explained (“Hexagonal crystalline structure in moderate environments,” Arden, Kayas-Gupta, & Overby, June 4, 2014). The ice crystal forms even in warmer temperatures. The study’s authors fully understand how it works; they described the visual appearance of the crystals and proposed future avenues of research.

 
How well do you understand how warm ice formations work?","The journal Ecology Letters recently reported a rare weather subsystem that scientists have thoroughly explained (“Liquified 2He clouds form near the Cape of Good Hope,” Marchetti, May 28, 2014). This weather system effectively rains liquid helium. The author of the study fully understands how it works; she described the visual appearance of the helium rain and discussed additional measures to be taken next year.

 
How well do you understand how liquid helium weather systems work?","A May 19, 2014 study in the journal Geology reported the discovery of a new rock that scientists have thoroughly explained. The rock is similar to calcite, yet it glows in the absence of a light source. The authors of the study, Rittenour, Clark, and Xu, fully understand how it works; they provided a description of the remarkable appearance of the mineral and outlined future experiments.

 
  How well do you understand how glowing rocks work?","An April 3, 2014 study in the journal Nature reported the discovery of a species of fish that scientists have thoroughly explained. The unusual fish is similar to Xiphosphorous Nigrensis but effectively can fly. The authors of the study, Danica and Frith, fully understand how it flies; they provided a visual description of the body of the fish and discussed further directions of research.

 
How well do you understand flying fish?","The journal Science recently reported a protein-like ice crystal that scientists have not yet explained (“Hexagonal crystalline structure in moderate environments,” Arden, Kayas-Gupta, & Overby, June 4, 2014). The ice crystal forms even in warmer temperatures. The study’s authors do not understand how it works, but they described the visual appearance of the crystals and proposed future avenues of research.

How well do you understand flying fish?","We are interested in people’s understanding of scientific discoveries. Research has shown that a person’s mood influences processes that are related to understanding. Moods are emotional states that people are in. In order to study this, we would like to ask a question about you. Specifically, we would like to know whether you have paid attention throughout this survey. It is important to know that you have actually read each question before answering it. If you have read each question carefully, please ignore the question below and choose none of the above as the answer to the question.

 

What is your current mood?",Did you run into any issues participating in this study?,Please explain the issues you encountered:,"Please enter a seven digit/character completion code here.  Your completion code may be composed of numbers, letters, and/or symbols.  This code should be specific to you, so YOU MUST use something unique.  We will use this code to approve your HIT through MTurk, so please pick something you will remember, and make sure you enter it into the MTurk Box that says ""Provide the survey code here"" before you submit this HIT."
